Video Recap

- **Simple linear regression** is the most common regression model. We model the distribution of the random response variable $Y$, conditional on the predictor $X$ taking the value $x$. We assume
$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \varepsilon $$
where $\varepsilon \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma)$, and values of $\epsilon$ from different observations are assumed to be independent of each other.

Video Recap

- In regression, we **condition on $X$**, and look at how to predict $Y$ at a given value of $X$.
- This means that $X$ does not need to be a random variable - it can be experimentally fixed to take pre-specified values, known as a **fixed design**.

## Question 4

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

In which of the following situations would it be reasonable to construct a regression model for $Y$, as a function of $X$?

Select all that apply.


- [x] Both $Y$ and $X$ are random variables.

- [x] $Y$ is a random variable, but $X$ is not because it is experimentally fixed to pre-specified values.

- [ ] $X$ is a random variable, but $Y$ is not because it is experimentally fixed to pre-specified values.
