Video Recap

- The **coefficient of determination $r^2$** is the proportion of variation in $y$ that is explained by a linear regression against $x$. It can be found easily in regression output.
- The **sample correlation coefficient** $r=\frac{s_{xy}}{\sqrt{s_{xx}s_{yy}}}$ is quite commonly used in practice as a measure of strength of the relationship between two quantitative variables.
- $r$ is a natural estimator of the correlation between two random variables $\rho$, introduced in Lecture 3. It can be written as
$$\text{sign}(\hat{b}_{1})\sqrt{r^2} $$
- That is, for an increasing relationship (with positive estimated slope) $r=\sqrt{r^2}>0$, and for a decreasing relationship (with negative estimated slope), $r=-\sqrt{r^2}<0$

Video Recap

- When studying the association between two quantitative variables, a good numerical summary is the correlation coefficient, or you could use the estimated regression line, obtained using $\texttt{fitlm}$ on Matlab.
- When making inferences about the relationship between two quantitative variables, we use a hypothesis test or confidence interval for the regression slope $\beta_1$, again using $\texttt{fitlm}$ on Matlab.
- Sometimes, the research question is about prediction (rather than hypothesis tests or confidence intervals about a model parameter), using the $\texttt{predict}$. You can think about this as a different type of inference procedure, for a different type of research question, that doesn't really fit on the summary slide.
