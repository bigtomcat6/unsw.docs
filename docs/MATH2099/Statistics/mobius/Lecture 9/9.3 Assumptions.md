## Question 1

<div class="how_qb">

**Concept**

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Xu3KoB2VUA" title="L9 07 Regression Assumptions" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Video Recap

- There are four types of assumption in the linear regression model, $y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+e_i$:
  - The conditional mean of $y$ is a **linear function of $x$**
  - The $e_i$ have been drawn **independently** of one another
  - The $e_i$ have the **same variance**
  - The $e_i$ have been drawn from a **normal distribution**

Video Recap

- We will use the estimated errors, or **residuals**, to check assumptions:

$$\hat{e}_i = y_i -\hat{y}(x_i) = y_i - (\hat{b}_0+\hat{b}_1 x_i)  $$

- It is frequently helpful to plot the residuals in two ways:
  - A **residual vs fits plot** to check Assumptions 1 and 3 - we want them to look like **random noise**, no pattern.
  - A **normal quantile plot** of residuals to check Assumption 4.
- Whether or not Assumption 2 (Independence) is satisfies is determined by the sampling design.

## Question 3

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

When fitting a least squares regression line to data, there are four regression assumptions.  Match each assumption to the method of checking that it is satisfied.

- <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: '--'},
    {label: '1', selected: true},
    {label: '2'},
    {label: '3'},
    {label: '4'}]" /> The errors have the same variance

- <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: '--'},
    {label: '1'},
    {label: '2'},
    {label: '3'},
    {label: '4', selected: true}]" /> The errors are independent

- <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: '--'},
    {label: '1'},
    {label: '2', selected: true},
    {label: '3'},
    {label: '4'}]" /> The errors come from a normal distribution

- <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: '--'},
    {label: '1'},
    {label: '2'},
    {label: '3', selected: true},
    {label: '4'}]" /> The conditional mean of $Y$ is a linear function of $x$

1.	_Check for no fan-shape on the residual vs fits plot_

2.	_Check for a straight line on the normal quantile plot_

3.	_Check for no U-shape on the residual vs fits plot_

4.	_Depends on the study design_

Video Recap

- To plot residuals from a regression model on Matlab, use the $\texttt{plotResiduals}$ function.
- Remember we are looking for **no pattern** on the residual vs fits plot, and a **straight line** on the qqplot.
