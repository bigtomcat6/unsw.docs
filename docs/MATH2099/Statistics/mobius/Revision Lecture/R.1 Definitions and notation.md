- Video Recap
  - **Random experiment** – any experiment whose exact outcome cannot be predicted with certainty.
  - **Outcome** – the result of a random experiment.
  - **Event** – a set of possible outcomes.
  - **Sample space** – the set containing all possible outcomes.
  - **Probability** of an event $E$, $P(E)$ – a number measuring how likely event E is from a random experiment. Usually, this is interpreted as the long run frequency of $E$ in repeat experiments.

Video Recap

- **Union** - $A \cup B =$ event "either $A$ **or** $B$ occurs"
- **Intersection** - $A \cap B =$ event "both $A$ **and** $B$ occurs"
- Complement - $A^c =$ event "$A$ does not occur" ($=A$)
- $A \subseteq B$ means $A$ **implies** $B$
- If $A \cap B = \varnothing$ then the events are **mutually exclusive**
- **De Morgan's laws:** $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$ and  $(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$

## Question 3

<div class="how_qb">

**Exercise**

A survey of students at UNSW recorded the age of students and whether or not they have ever been to Perth before.

Let $A$ be the event that a student has been to Perth before, and let $B$ be the event that a student is 19 years old or younger.

 

Which of these correctly expresses "the student has never been to Perth before and is 19 years old or younger" in terms of events $A$ and $B$

 - [x] $A^c \cap B$
 - [ ] $A \cap B^c$
 - [ ] $A \cup B^c$
 - [ ] $A \cap B$
 - [ ] $A \cup B$
 - [ ] $A^c \cup B^c$
 - [ ] $A^c \cup B$
 - [ ] $A^c \cap B^c$


Which of these correctly expresses "the student has been to Perth before or is 20 years old or older" in terms of events  $A$ and  $B$?

 - [ ] $A \cup B$
 - [x] $A \cup B^c$
 - [ ] $A^c \cap B$
 - [ ] $A^c \cap B^c$
 - [ ] $A^c \cup B$
 - [ ] $A^c \cup B^c$
 - [ ] $A \cap B^c$
 - [ ] $A \cap B$
