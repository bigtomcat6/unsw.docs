Video Recap

- The probability measure $\mathbb{P}(\cdot)$ satisfies:
  * $0 \leq \mathbb{P}(E) \leq 1$ for any event $E$
  * $\mathbb{P}(S) = 1$
  * for any (infinite) sequence of mutually exclusive events $E_1, E_2, \ldots$, it holds that $\mathbb{P} \left( \bigcup\limits_{i=1}^\infty E_i \right) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty \mathbb{P}\left(E_i\right)$
- Results which can be derived from these axioms:
  * If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, $\mathbb{P}(A \cup B) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B)$
  * $\mathbb{P}(A^c) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(A)$
  * The additive law, $\mathbb{P}(A \cup B) = \mathbb{P}(A) + \mathbb{P}(B) - \mathbb{P}(A \cap B)$

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

$40\%$ of people watched Game of Thrones, and $50\%$ think we need to do more to address climate change. $30\%$ of people watched Game of Thrones and think we need to do more about climate change.

 
**a)** What proportion of people either watched Game of Thrones or think we need to do more about climate change?

  
  - `0.6` _(Enter the exact value)_


**b)** What proportion of people neither watched Game of Thrones nor think we need to do more about climate change?

  
  - `0.4` _(Enter the exact value)_
