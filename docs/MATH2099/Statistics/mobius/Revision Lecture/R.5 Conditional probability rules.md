Video Recap

- If $B \subseteq A$, $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = 1$
Multiplication law: $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A \mid B) \times \mathbb{P}(B)$
- Law of total probability:  $\mathbb{P}(A) = \mathbb{P}(A \mid B) \times \mathbb{P}(B) + \mathbb{P}(A \mid B^c) \times \mathbb{P}(B^c)$
- Bayes' rule: if $\mathbb{P}(A) > 0$ and $\mathbb{P}(B) > 0$, then $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \mathbb{P}(B \mid A) \times \dfrac{\mathbb{P}(A)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}$

## Question 2

**Example**

A new medical procedure has been shown to be effective in the early detection of an illness and a medical screening of the population is proposed. The probability that the test correctly identifies someone with the illness as positive is $0.99$, and the probability that someone without the illness is correctly identified by the test is $0.95$. The incidence of the illness in the general population is $0.001$.

What is the chance that a randomly selected person gets a positive result?

- `0.051` _(Enter the answer correct to 3 decimal places)_

You take the test, and the result is positive. What is the probability that you have the disease?

- `0.019` _(Enter the answer correct to 3 decimal places)_
