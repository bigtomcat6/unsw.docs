Video Recap

- If all outcomes are equally likely, $\mathbb{P}(E) = \dfrac{\text{number of outcomes in } E}{\text{total number of possible outcomes}}$

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

You survey ten people and ask them if they think marijuana should be legalised. An outcome is a set of ten yes/no responses, e.g. YYNNYNNNYN.

How many possible outcomes are there?

- `1024` _(Enter the exact value using Maple syntax)_

How many ways could four people, out of the ten, answer “yes"?

- `210` _(Enter the exact value)_

Assume all outcomes are equally likely (meaning that the true probability of each person saying “yes" is $50\%$).

What is the probability that exactly four out of the ten respondents say “yes"?

- `210/1024` _(Enter the exact value as a fraction)_
