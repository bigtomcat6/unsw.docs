Video Recap

- The **conditional probability** of $B$, conditional on $A$ if $\mathbb{P}(A) > 0$, is defined as $\mathbb{P}(B \mid A) = \dfrac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(A)} =$probability of $B$, given that $A$ has occurred

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**
 

A bin contains $5$ defective, $10$ partially defective and $25$ acceptable transistors. Defective transistors immediately fail when put in use, while partially defective ones fail after a couple of hours of use. A transistor is chosen at random from the bin and put into use. If it does not immediately fail, what is the probability it is acceptable?

- `5/7`  _(Enter the exact value as a fraction)_
