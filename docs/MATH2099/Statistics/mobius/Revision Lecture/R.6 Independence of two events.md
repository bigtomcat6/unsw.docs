Video Recap

- Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be independent if and only if $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A) \times \mathbb{P}(B)$
- Independence implies that $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \mathbb{P}(A)$ and $\mathbb{P}(B \mid A) = \mathbb{P}(B)$

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Letâ€™s assume that the probability a student caught the bus to UNSW today is $60\%$, the probability that they passed first year maths is $90\%$, and the probability they caught the bus today and passed first year maths is $54\%$.

The probability a student has an Opal card on them is $90\%$, and the probability they have an Opal card and caught the bus today is $59\%$.

Use this information to answer the following questions.

Is catching a bus to UNSW independent of whether or not a student passed first year maths?

- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

Is catching a bus to UNSW independent of whether a student has an Opal card on them?

- [ ] Yes
- [x] No

## Question 3

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

An electric system composed of n separate components is said to be a parallel system if it functions when at least one of the components functions.


For such a system, if component $i$, independently of other components, functions with probability $p_i$, $i = 1,\ldots,n$, what is the probability the system functions?

 - [ ] $1 - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (1-p_i)$
 - [ ] $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (1-p_i)$
 - [ ] $\prod\limits_{i=1}^n (1-p_i)$
 - [ ] $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n p_i$
 - [ ] $1 - \prod\limits_{i=1}^n p_i$
 - [ ] $1 - \sum\limits_{i=1}^n p_i$
 - [ ] $\prod\limits_{i=1}^n p_i$
 - [x] $1 - \prod\limits_{i=1}^n (1-p_i)$
