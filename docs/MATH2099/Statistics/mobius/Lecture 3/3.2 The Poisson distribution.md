Video Recap

- We use the **Poisson distribution** the number of occurrences of some random phenomenon in a fixed period of time.
- Suppose $X$ is the number of occurrences. We say that $X$ is a **Poisson random variable** with parameter $\lambda$, i.e. $X \sim \mathcal{P}(\lambda)$, if $p(x)=e^{-\lambda}\dfrac{\lambda^x}{x!}$ for $x \in S_X=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$.
- Properties of the Poisson distribution ($X \sim \mathcal{P}(\lambda)$):
  - $\displaystyle\sum_{x\in S_X} p(x) = 1$
  - $\mathbb{E}(X) = \lambda$
  - $\mathbb{V}\operatorname{ar}(X)=\lambda$

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Over a 10-minute period, a counter records an average of 1.3 gamma particles per millisecond coming from a radioactive substance. To a good approximation, the distribution of the count, $X$, of gamma particles during the next millisecond is Poisson distributed.

Determine $\lambda$.

`1.3` *(Enter the exact value)*

Determine the probability of observing one or more gamma particles during the next millisecond.

`0.73` *(Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places)*

Determine the variance of this number.

`1.3` *(Enter the exact value)*

## Question 3

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Suppose that the number of kangaroos killed per week on a particular stretch of road has Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda=20$.

In the long-run, in what proportion of weeks will the number of dead roos be at most $10$?

`0.011` *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places)*

In the long-run, in what proportion of weeks will the number of dead roos exceed $20$?

`0.44` *(Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places)*

In the long-run, in what proportion of weeks will the number of dead roos be between $10$ and $20$, inclusive?

`0.554` *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places)*

In the long-run, in what proportion of weeks will the number of dead roos be strictly between $10$ and $20$?

`0.46` *(Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places)*

Video Recap

Since it was derived as a limit case of the Binomial distribution when $n$ is 'large' and $\pi$ is 'small', one can expect the Poisson distribution to be a good approximation to $\text{Bin}(n,\pi)$ in that case.
