Video Recap

- We can use the **binomial distribution** when
  - the outcome of a random experiment can be classified as either a "$\text{Success}$" or a "$\text{Failure}$" (i.e. $S=\{\text{Success},\text{Failure}\}$),
  - we observe a $\text{Success}$ with probability $\pi$,
  - $n$ independent repetitions of this experiment are performed.
- Define $X$ to be the number of $\text{Successes}$ observed over the $n$ repetitions. We say that $X$ is a **binomial random variable** with parameters $n$ and $\pi$, i.e. $X \sim \text{Bin}(n,\pi)$.
- The binomial probability mass function is given by $p(x)=\displaystyle\binom{n}{x}\pi^x(1-\pi)^{n-x}$ for $x \in S_X$.
- Some binomial distribution properties:
  - Using the binomial expansion, $\displaystyle \sum_{x \in S_X} p(x) = \sum_{x=0}^n \binom{n}{x}\pi^x(1-\pi)^{n-x}  = (\pi+(1-\pi))^n =1$.
  - if $X_1 \sim \text{Bin}(n_1,\pi)$, $X_2 \sim \text{Bin}(n_2,\pi)$ and $X_1$ is independent of $X_2$, then $X_1+X_2 \sim \text{Bin}(n_1+n_2,\pi)$.
- If $X \sim \text{Bin}(n,\pi)$,
  - $\mu = \mathbb{E} (X) = n \pi$,
  - $\sigma^2=\mathbb{V}\operatorname{ar}(X)=n\pi(1-\pi)$.

## Question 3

**Example**

It is known that disks produced by a certain company will be defective with probability $0.01$ independently of each other. The company sells the disk in packages of $10$ and offers a money-back guarantee if more than $1$ of the disks are defective.

In the long-run, what proportion of package purchases can get their money back?

`0.0043` *(Enter your answer correct to 4 decimal places)*

If someone buys three packages, what is the probability that they could get their money back on exactly one of them?

`0.013` *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places)*
