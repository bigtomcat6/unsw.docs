## Question 1

<div class="how_qb">

A particular coin is biased. Each time it is flipped, the probability of getting a head is $\mathbb{P}(H) = 0.7$. Each flip is independent of the other flips.

**a)** In a game, the coin is flipped 11 times. Let $X$ be the total number of times the coin shows a head out of 11 flips. Calculate the following probabilities:

- **i)** What is the probability of getting exactly 4 heads?

  `0.017` *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places.)*

- **ii)** What is the probability of getting more than 4 heads?
  
  `0.978` *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places.)*

**b)** Compute the expected value of $X$.

$\mu_X =$ `7.7` *(Enter the exact value)*


**c)** Compute the standard deviation of $X$.

$\sigma_X =$ `1.52` *(Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places)*

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

In a given country, the average weight of a newborn in grams is approximately normally distributed with a mean of $3,470$ and a standard deviation of $600$.

**a)** Find the probability that the weight of a randomly selected newborn is less than $4,100$.

`0.853` *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places)*

**b)** Find the probability that the weight of a randomly selected newborn is between $2,700$ and $4,100$.

`0.753` *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places)*

**c)** Below what weight (in grams) would we expect $85\%$ of newborns to be?

`4092` *(Enter your answer correct to the nearest integer)*
