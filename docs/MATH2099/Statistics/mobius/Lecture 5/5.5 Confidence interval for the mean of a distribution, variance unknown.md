## Question 1

<div class="how_qb">

**Concept**

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ZvhGxG8Y2M" title="L5 09 Student&#39;s t distribution" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Video Recap

- When $\sigma$ is unknown, we can estimate $\sigma$ using the **sample standard deviation** $S=\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n-1} \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left(X_i-\bar{X}\right)^2}$ and derive a confidence interval using $T=\dfrac{\bar{X}-\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}$.
- If we calculate $T$ from a normal random sample, its exact distribution is the $t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom $T \sim t_{n-1} $ referred to as **Student's $t$-distribution**.
- This is a special distribution, which is symmetric around zero and bell-shaped, but with fatter tails than the standard normal (especially when the degrees of freedom are small). We can use software to find quantiles from the $t_{n-1}$ distribution to use in calculating confidence intervals.

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

In a sample of $185$ UNSW students, average hours slept was $6.12$ hours, with a sample standard deviation of $2.497$ hours. Assume that the true standard deviation of hours slept is not known.

What is a $95\%$ confidence interval for the true mean hours slept?

$[$ `5.76` $,$ `6.48` $]$ *(Enter your answer to 2 decimal places)*

Video Recap

- A $100\times(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for $\mu$ is given by $\displaystyle \left[\bar{x}-t_{n-1;1-\alpha/2}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}},\bar{x}+t_{n-1;1-\alpha/2}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right]$ if
  - we have a random sample of a variable $X$,
  - $X$ is normally distributed.
- In practice it doesn't matter if X is not normal - if $\bar{X}$ is approximately normal then this confidence interval will be approximately correct.

## Question 4

<div class="how_qb">

**Concept**

An article in *Materials Engineering* describes the results of tensile adhesion test on $22$ *U*-700 alloy specimens. The load at specimen failure is as ollows (in megapascals):

`7.6, 8.1, 11.7, 14.3, 14.3, 14.1, 8.3, 12.3, 15.9, 16.4, 11.3, 12.0, 12.9, 15.0, 13.2, 14.6, 13.5, 10.4, 13.8, 15.6, 12.2, 11.2`

Construct a $99\%$ confidence interval for the true average load at failure for this type of alloy.

$[$ `11.18` $,$ `14.16` $]$ *(Enter your answer to 2 decimal places)*

What assumptions did you make to construct this confidence interval

- [x] We have a random sample of specimens.

- [x] Load at failure is normal.
