## Question 1

<div class="how_qb">

The Charpy V-notch (CVN) technique measures impact energy and is often used to determine whether or not a material experiences a ductile-to-brittle transition with decreasing temperature. Ten measurements of impact energy (in J) on specimens of steel cut at $60^\circ C$ are as follows:

`64.2, 63.9, 64.7, 63.3, 63.7, 64.3, 63.7, 64.7, 63.1, 64.4`

**a)** Find a 90% CI for $\mu$, the mean impact energy for that kind of steel.

$[$ `63.679` $,$ `64.321` $]$ *(Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places)*


**b)** Determine the minimum number of specimens so that we are 90% confident of estimating mean impact energy $\mu$ to within 0.3 J of its correct value. Use the sample standard deviation from the above data as an initial guess of the value for the true standard deviation.

- `10` *(Enter your answer as an integer)*

**c)** What assumptions did you make to construct this confidence interval?

- [x] Impact energy is normal.
- [ ] Sample size is large enough.
- [x] We have a random sample of specimens.

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

A survey was conducted on a random sample of students in an engineering course. Out of the 231 students surveyed, 137 of them claim that they have had a cold during the term.

**a)** Find a 98% confidence interval for the true proportion of students in the course who have had a cold during the term.

$[$ `0.518` $,$ `0.668` $]$ *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places)*


**b)** To construct this confidence interval we needed to assume that $\hat{p}$ was approximately normal. Does the normality assumption seem reasonable in this case?

- [ ] Yes, because $n$ is large.
- [ ] Yes, because $n \hat{p} > 5$.
- [x] Yes, because $n \hat{p} (1 - \hat{p}) > 5$.
