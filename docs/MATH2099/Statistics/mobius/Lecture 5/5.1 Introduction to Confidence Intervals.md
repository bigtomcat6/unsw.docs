Video Recap

- Formally, a $100(1-\alpha)\%$ confidence interval for an unknown parameter $\theta$ is a ‘random interval’ $[L,U]$, where $L$ and $U$ are statistics such that $P(L \leq \theta \leq U) = 1 - \alpha$.
- We can construct a confidence interval whenever we have an estimator of $\theta$ whose samplng distribution is known.
- For example, to derive a confidence interval for $\mu$ if we knew $\sigma$, we
  - find a range of values that contains $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ with probability $1-\alpha$,
  - apply the above CLT result,
  - solve for $\mu$.

**Exercise**

Which of the following summarises the argument behind a $95\%$ confidence interval for $\mu$? 

- [x] If the sample mean is normally distributed, then $95\%$ of the time, the sample mean is within $1.96$ standard errors of the true mean. This means that for $95\%$ of random samples, $\mu$ is within $1.96$ standard errors of the observed sample mean.

- [ ] If the data are normally distributed, then $95\%$ of the time, the data are within $1.96$ standard errors of the true mean.  This means that for $95\%$ of random samples, $\mu$ is within $1.96$ standard errors of the observed data.

- [ ] If the true mean is normally distributed, then for $95\%$ of random samples, the true mean is within $1.96$ standard errors of the sample mean.

- [ ] Confidence intervals are conceptually complicated so it is best to use Matlab to get the answer directly.
