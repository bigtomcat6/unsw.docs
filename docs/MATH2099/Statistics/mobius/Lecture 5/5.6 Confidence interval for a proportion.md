Video Recap

- If we want to make inferences about a proportion $\pi$ , we can do so using the sample proportion from a random sample, using the fact that $\frac{\hat{P} - \pi}{\sqrt{\hat{P}(1-\hat{P})/n}} \overset{a}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ (from the Central Limit Theorem).
- An approximate two-sided confidence interval of level $100\times(1-\alpha)\%$ for $\pi$ is given by $\left[\hat{p}-z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}},\hat{p}+z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}} \,\right]$if
  - $\hat{p}$ is the observed sample proportion from a **random sample** of size $n$,
  - It can be assumed that $\hat{p}$ comes from an **approximately normal** distribution (reasonable if $n\hat{p}(1-\hat{p}) > 5$).

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

In the class data, $57$ students were doing a double degree, out of $185$.

Find a $95\%$ confidence interval for the true proportion of UNSW engineering undergraduate students doing a double degree.

$[$ `0.24` $,$ `0.37` $]$ *(Enter your answer to 2 decimal places)*

What did you need to assume to answer this question?


- [x] $\hat{p}$ is approximately normal.

- [ ] The data are approximately normal (in particular, they are not right-skewed and have no big outliers). 

- [x] A random sample of UNSW undergraduate students was taken.

Where possible, check if these assumptions are reasonable.

Video Recap

- We can use confidence intervals to make inferences on a single variable.
- If we have a single categorical variable that only takes two values, we can make inferences about the true value of the proportion using a confidence interval for a proportion.
- If we have a single quantitative variable, we can make inferences about the true mean using a confidence interval for a mean.

Video Recap

- The **margin of error** in estimating π is $z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$.
- A good way to decide on your sample size is to work out what value of $n$ is needed such that the margin of error is less than some pre-specified value $e$.
- Solving $e=z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$ for $n$, the sample size should be $n=\left(\dfrac{z_{1-\alpha/2}}{e}\right)^2 \hat{p}(1-\hat{p})$.
- A conservative approach that is sometimes used is to note that $\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\leq \frac{1}{4}$ and hence use **$n=\frac{1}{4}\left(\dfrac{z_{1-\alpha/2}}{e}\right)^2$.** But don't do this unless you expect π to be close to 0.5.

## Question 5

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

What is the minimum sample size needed to estimate the proportion of students doing a double degree to within $0.1$ of its correct value, with $95\%$ confidence? (Recall that the sample proportion is $\hat{p}=\dfrac{57}{185}$.)

`82`  *(Enter your answer as an integer)*
