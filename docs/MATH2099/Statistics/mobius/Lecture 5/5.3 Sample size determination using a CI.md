Video Recap

- The **margin of error** in estimating $\mu$ is $z_{1-\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$, for $100\times (1-\alpha)\%$ confidence.
- A good way to decide on your sample size is to work out what value of $n$ is needed such that the margin of error is less than some pre-specified value $e$.
- Solving $e=z_{1-\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ for $n$, the sample size should be $n =\left(\frac{z_{1-\alpha/2 }\sigma}{e} \right)^2$.

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Assume that the true standard deviation of hours slept is $2.5$ hours.

At least how many students should we sample to be $95\%$ confident of getting within $15$ minutes of the true mean hours slept?

 `385` *(Enter your answer as an integer)*
