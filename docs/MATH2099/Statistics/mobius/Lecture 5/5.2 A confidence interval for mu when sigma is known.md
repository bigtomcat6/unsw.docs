Video Recap

- An approximate confidence interval of level $100\times(1-\alpha)\%$ for $\mu$ is $\left[\bar{x}-z_{1-\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},\bar{x}+z_{1-\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right]$ if
  - we have a random sample of a variable $X$ for which we know the true standard deviation $\sigma$,
  - $\overline{X}$ is approximately normal.

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

In a sample of $185$ UNSW students, average hours slept was $6.12$ hours. Assume that the true standard deviation of hours slept is $2.5$ hours.

What is a $95\%$ confidence interval for the true mean hours slept?

$[$ `5.76` $,$ `6.48` $]$ *(Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places)*

We need to assume that the sample mean hours slept is normally distributed, which seems reasonable (by the Central Limit Theorem) for a sample this large.  What else did you need to assume to answer this question?

- [x] We have a random sample of students.

- [ ] The hours slept by students is approximately normal.

- [ ] Nothing

Video Recap

- If you want to have more confidence about where $\mu$ is (e.g. 99% instead of 95%), you need to use a wider confidence interval.
- The length of a $100\times(1-\alpha)\%$confidence interval measures how precise estimation has been. The shorter the interval, the more precise estimation has been. Smaller $\sigma$ and larger $n$ lead to a shorter interval.
- We use the term "confidence'" instead of "probability" because while the method of interval construction has $100(1-\alpha)\%$ chance of capturing the true parameter, any given interval is not random. It either captures the parameter or it doesn't.
