Video Recap

- In **statistical inference**, the general problem that is addressed is
  - There is a population of interest.
  - We have observations on a subset of the population only, called a sample.
  - We want to learn (make inferences) about the population from the sample.
- In order to make inferences about a population from a sample, we need a random sample
  - to ensure a sample that is representative of the population from which it is obtained, and
  - to provide a framework for the application of probability theory to problems of sampling.
- The set of observations $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ constitutes a **random sample** if
  - the $X_i$'s are independent random variables, and
  - every $X_i$ has the same probability distribution.

**Exercise**

Which of the following is ensured by taking a random sample?  Tick all that apply.

- [ ] It ensures that the sample mean is equal to the population mean.

- [x] The observations are independent of each other.

- [x] The observations are identically distributed (they have the same probability distribution).

- [x] It ensures your sample is representative of the population of interest.
