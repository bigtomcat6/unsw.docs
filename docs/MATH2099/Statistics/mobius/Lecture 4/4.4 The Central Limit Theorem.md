## Question 1

Video Recap

- The **Central Limit Theorem**: If $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ is a random sample taken from a population with mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^2$, and if $\overline{X}$ is the sample mean, then the limiting distribution of $\dfrac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$as $n\to \infty$, is the **standard normal distribution**.

 Would you like to see the proof? (Optional: not for the faint-hearted!)

Video Recap

- Go to <http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/index.html> for a useful interactive tool for studying the Central Limit Theorem.
- The Central Limit Theorem can work very quickly, meaning averages of small samples can be approximately normal, but it doesn't work as well for strongly skewed distributions or long-tailed distributions (with occasional, big outliers).
- A general rule-of-thumb is that one can be fairly confident of the normal approximation whenever the sample size $n$ is at least 30 (unless the distribution is really strongly skewed or has some big outliers).
- The Central Limit Theorem helps explain why many natural populations exhibit a bell-shaped (i.e., approximately normal) distribution.

## Question 3

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Assume that hours slept by a student has mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.

What assumptions are needed to determine the sampling distribution of $\overline{X}$? 

- [x] We have a random sample.

- [ ] Hours of sleep is normally distributed.

- [ ] The sample size is large enough.
