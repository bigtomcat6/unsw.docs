## Question 1

**Concept**

Video Recap

- An estimator $\hat{\Theta}$ has a **sampling distribution**, which depends on the distribution of $X$ in the population, and the sample size.
- The sampling distribution tells us how well $\hat{\Theta}$ estimates $\theta$.

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Consider the hours slept data, available on Moodle as hoursSlept.csv. We will treat the responses in this dataset as the population and will sample from it.

What is the value of $\mu$?

`6.1109` *(Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places)*

Use the randsample function on Matlab to take a random sample of size n=5 from this "population". Note down what $\bar{x}$ is.

(Alternatively, you can use the numpy.random.choice function on Python, with replace=False.)

Repeat the process a few times. Observe how variable the estimates are, from one sample to the next.

Now repeat the process but with samples of size $n=50$. How does the variability in $\bar{X}$ for $n=50$, compare to the variability in $\bar{X}$ when $n=5$?

- [ ] It is larger for $n=50$

- [ ] Stays the same

- [x] It is smaller for $n=50$

## Question 3

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Assume that hours slept by a student is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.

What is the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ for a random sample?

<HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: 'Pareto'},
    {label: 'Uniform'},
    {label: 'Binomial'},
    {label: 'Poisson'},
    {label: 'Normal', selected: true},
    {label: 'Exponential'}
]" />

What is the mean of the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ for a random sample?

*(Enter your answer in terms of $\mu$, $\sigma$ and $n$)*

`mu` $(\mu)$

What is the square root of the variance of the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ for a random sample?

*(Enter your answer in terms of $\mu$, $\sigma$ and $n$)*

`sigma/n^(1/2)` $(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$

## Question 4

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Assume that hours slept by a student is normally distributed with unknown mean and standard deviation of $2.5$ hours. Ideally, we would like to estimate the true mean to within at least $15$ minutes of its true value, that is, we want $|\bar{x} - \mu| < 0.25$.

For a random sample of size $5$, what is $\mathbb{P}(|\bar{X} - \mu| < 0.25 )$?

`0.177` *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places)*

For a random sample of size $50$, what is $\mathbb{P}(|\bar{X} - \mu| < 0.25 )$?

`0.52` *(Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places)*

What is the smallest sample size needed to ensure $\mathbb{P}(|\bar{X} - \mu| < 0.25 ) \geq 0.95$?

`385` *(Enter your answer as an integer)*
