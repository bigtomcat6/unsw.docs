## Question 1

<div class="how_qb">

Consider the following sample of bond strength for 30 bonds:  

`3.4, 0.7, 13.4, 14.8, 34.8, 27.0, 30.9, 13.2, 23.6, 9.6, 17.4, 28.6, 22.1, 11.6, 15.6, 4.5, 33.2, 20.0, 26.8, 0.6, 28.8, 22.5, 23.8, 1.7, 26.6, 15.7, 21.9, 34.2, 27.9, 23.7`

Assume that the true standard deviation of bond strength is $\sigma = 11$.

Consider the distribution of the sample mean, $\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$.


**a)** What is the standard error of the sample mean?

 `2.008` *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places)*

**b)** Which of the following conditions needs to be true for the sample mean to be approximately normal? Tick all that apply.

- [x] We have a random sample of bond strength measurements.
- [ ] Measurements of bond strength are approximately normally distributed.
- [ ] Sample size is large enough, as checked using $np(1-p) > 5$.


**c)** Construct a normal quantile plot. Which of the below is the best description of what you see?

- [ ] Excellent approximation to normality - points are all very close to the line
- [x] Fair approximation to normality - the points arenâ€™t all on the line, maybe a few are off the line or maybe several are off but not too far away
- [ ] Poor approximation to normality - the data has some big outliers and/or strong skew.

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

We take a random sample $X_1,X_2,\ldots X_{46}$ from a distribution with mean $\mu$.  Consider the following estimators:

- $\hat{\Theta}_1=X_{5}$
- $\hat{\Theta}_2=\dfrac{\left(X_{5}+X_{30}+X_{36}\right)}{3}$
- $\hat{\Theta}_3=\dfrac{\left(6 X_{29}+6 X_{41}\right)}{7}$

**a)** Compute the following expectations:

*(Enter your answers in terms of $\mu$)*

 $\mathbb{E} \left(\hat{\Theta}_1\right) =$ `mu` $(\mu)$

 $\mathbb{E} \left(\hat{\Theta}_2\right) =$ `mu` $(\mu)$

 $\mathbb{E} \left(\hat{\Theta}_3\right) =$ `(12/7)*mu` $(\frac{12}{7} \mu)$




**b)** Hence, which of $\hat{\Theta}_1$ , $\hat{\Theta}_2$ and  $\hat{\Theta}_3$ are unbiased for $\mu$ ?

- [x] $\hat{\Theta}_1$
- [x] $\hat{\Theta}_2$ 
- [ ] $\hat{\Theta}_3$
