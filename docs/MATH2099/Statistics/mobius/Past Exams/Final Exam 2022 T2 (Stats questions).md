**This Statistics question is worth [5 marks]**
:::

A certain computer chip manufactured by the company Beta is reported to last at least eight years without failing. In a sample of 169 computer chips, it is reported that 15 computer chips failed to last eight years. 

**a)** **[2 marks]** The company Beta must ensure that the true long-run proportion (or probability) of all such trials π should not exceed 10% to keep on making this claim. Calculate the test statistic and p-value for a suitably defined hypothesis test.

Test Statistic = `number` *Give your answer to four decimal places* 

 $p-$value = `number` *Give your answer to four decimal places* 

**b)** **[2 marks]** The p-value calculated above is only an approximate p-value based on the central limit theorem. Instead, calculate the exact p-value. 

Hint: You might want to consider the Binomial distribution.

Exact $p-$value = `number` *Give your answer to four decimal places* 

**c)** **[2 marks]** Manufacturer would like to estimate the proportion of all such trials that would result in failure to within 0.05 of its true value, with 99% confidence. How many independent trials would be needed to achieve this? (You may use the above data to approximate π if needed.)

 `number` *Give your answer as an integer*

**d)** **[3 marks]** The manufacturer Chi is a competitor and claims that they are a better manufacturer of computer chips than Beta. Chi have reported that 20 of 155 computer chips have failed to last eight years. Define π2 be the true long-run proportion for the manufacturer Chi. To test their claim, we have the following hypothesis tests H0:π1=π2 versus Ha:π1>π2. The test can be conducted using the following test statistic 

$$Z = \frac{(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2) - (\pi_1 - \pi_2)}{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p}) \left(\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right)}} \sim N(0,1) $$

where p^=y1+y2n1+n2 is the pooled estimate of the long-run proportion and $\widehat{p}_1 = \frac{y_1}{n_1}$ and $\widehat{p}_2 = \frac{y_2}{n_2}$ are the sample proportions for the manufacturers Beta and Chi respectively. Calculate the test statistic and p−value for this hypothesis.

## Question 5

<div class="how_qb">

::: center
**This Statistics question is worth [5 marks]**
:::

A group of 20 participants took part in an experiment to assess their reasoning ability by measuring their intelligence quotient (IQ) score. It is hypothesized that the average IQ of the population is 105. You wish to test whether this claim is true or not. You may assume that the IQ score of an individual is normally distributed.

Below, the data is presented for analysis in Matlab

```:no-line-numbers
105 98 117 96 101 114 120 88 106 108 83 108 127 112 111 92 101 84 106 124
```

**a)** **[1 mark]** What is the correct null H0 and alternate Ha hypothesis?

$H_0:$ <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: 'μ'},
    {label: 'X̄'},
    {label: 'π'}]" /> <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: '≠'},
    {label: '>'},
    {label: '<'},
    {label: '='}]" /> `number`   	   

$H_a:$ <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: 'μ'},
    {label: 'X̄'},
    {label: 'π'}]" /> <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: '≠'},
    {label: '>'},
    {label: '<'},
    {label: '='}]" /> `number`  . 

 

**b)** **[2 marks]** Under H0, which of the following is the test statistic and its distribution 

- [ ] $\frac{\overline{X} - 105}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{20}}}$

- [ ] $\frac{\overline{X} - 105}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{20}}}$

- [ ] $\frac{\overline{X} + 105}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{20}}}$

- [ ] $\frac{\overline{X} + 105}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{20}}}$

which comes from a <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: 'N(0,1)'},
    {label: 't₁₉'},
    {label: 't₂₀'},
    {label: 't₁₈'}]" />	distribution.



**c)** **[2 marks]** Compute a 90% two-sided confidence interval for the true mean IQ:

**[** `number` **,** `number` **]** *Give your answer to four decimal places* 

 

**d)** **[3 marks]** Recall that in a hypothesis test, there are two possible ways to reach the wrong conclusion. Type I error refers to the event where we reject the null hypothesis H0 when H0 is true and type II error is the event where we fail to reject H0 when H0 is false. The probability of type II error is

$$ P\left(\text{type II error} \right) = P\left( \text{fail to reject } H_0 \text{ when } H_0 \text{ is not true} \right) = \beta$$

 and

$$ P\left(\text{rejecting } H_0 \text{ when } H_0 \text{ is not true} \right) = 1 - \beta$$

is called the power of the hypothesis test. Power measures the ability of a test to detect that H0 is false when an alternative is true.

Calculate the power when the true mean IQ score of the population is $\mu = 110$, that is

$$ Power = P \left(\text{rejecting } H_0 \text{ given that } \mu = 110 \right) $$

Assume that the population standard deviation is unknown and estimate σ using s from above. The sample size n=20 and the significance level is $\alpha = 0.10$.

## Question 6

<div class="how_qb">

**This Statistics question is worth [12 marks]**
:::

A feature of each Instagram user profile is the number of follows, an indicator of the user’s social network connectedness. Among university students on Instagram, the average number of Instagram followers has been estimated to be around 150. An experiment was run to examine the relationship between the number of Instagram followers and the user’s perceived social attractiveness. Undergraduate participants were randomly assigned to observe one of five Instagram profiles. Everything about the profiles were the same except for the number of followers, which were labelled as Very Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average and Very High. After viewing the profile, each participant was asked to fill out a questionnaire on the social attractiveness of the profile user. Each attractiveness score is an average of several ten-point questionnaire items, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree). Here is a summary of some of the data for the social attractiveness score:

| Number of followers | Very Low           | Below Average      | Average            | Above Average      | Very High          |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------ |
|                     | $X_{1,1}$        | $X_{2,1}$        | $X_{3,1}$        | $X_{4,1}$        | $X_{5,1}$        |
|                     | $X_{1,2}$        | $X_{2,2}$        | $X_{3,2}$        | $X_{4,2}$        | $X_{5,2}$        |
|                     | $\vdots$         | $\vdots$         | $\vdots$         | $\vdots$         | $\vdots$         |
|                     | $X_{1,15}$       | $X_{2,15}$       | $X_{3,16}$       | $X_{4,10}$       | $X_{5,12}$       |
| Mean                | $\overline{X}_1$ | $\overline{X}_2$ | $\overline{X}_3$ | $\overline{X}_4$ | $\overline{X}_5$ |
| Standard Deviation  | $s_1 = 1.09$     | $s_2 = 0.89$     | $s_3 = 1.13$     | $s_4 = 1.48$     | $s_5 = 1.03$     |

To compare the user's perceived social attractiveness, we decide to use the ANOVA model $X_{ij} = \mu_i + \epsilon_{ij}$

**a)** **[1 mark]** Is it reasonable to assume an equal variance $\sigma^2$ across the five groups? Comment on your answer.

<textarea></textarea>

**b)** **[2 marks]** Denote $\sigma^2$ the variance of the error term $\varepsilon_{ij}$. Provide an unbiased estimate of $\sigma^2$ using all the observations collected in the experiment.

 `number` *Give your answer to four decimal places*

 

**c)** **[2 marks]** Suppose we are interested to see if there is a difference in the mean user’s perceived social attractiveness for the different profiles. We want to conduct a hypothesis test to answer this question. Let $\mu_i$ denote the population mean of the users perceived social attractiveness for profile $i$.

 

The null hypothesis $H_0$ is:

- [ ] $H_0: \mu_1 = 0 \text{ and } \mu_2 = 0 \text{ and } \mu_3 = 0 \text{ and } \mu_4 = 0 \text{ and } \mu_5 = 0$

- [ ] $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3 = \mu_4 = \mu_5$

- [ ] $H_0: \mu_1 = 0 \text{ or } \mu_2 = 0 \text{ or } \mu_3 = 0 \text{ or } \mu_4 = 0 \text{ or } \mu_5 = 0$

The alternative hypothesis $H_a$ is
