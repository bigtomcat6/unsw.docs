Video Recap

- In hypothesis testing, we have a particular claim about a population parameter (a **null hypothesis**) that we want to test, and we have a sample of data we can use to test the claim.
- We use the sample data to test the null hypothesis by asking the question: “How much evidence do these data provide against the null hypothesis?”
- We will measure evidence against the null hypothesis using probability.

Video Recap

- The four-step procedure for Hypothesis Testing:
  - State the **null and alternative hypotheses**.
  - Calculate the **test statistic** and its **null distribution**.
  - Calculate the **$P$-value** or **rejection region**.
  - Conclusion.

## Question 4

<div class="how_qb">

David tosses a coin six times, and gets heads all six times.

(a) What is the chance of this happening, if he is tossing a fair coin?

`1/64` *(Enter the exact value)*

(b) What can we conclude, based on this probability?

- [ ] When you toss this particular coin, the probability that it will land heads is 1/64.

- [ ] The probability that the coin toss was fair (didn’t have probability 0.5 of heads) is $\frac{1}{64}$.

- [x] If the coin were fair, the probability of six heads in a row is small.  So there is evidence that the coin toss wasn’t fair (didn’t have probability 0.5 of landing heads)

- [ ] The probability of the coin landing heads is $\frac{6}{6}=1$.

Video Recap

- The statement being tested is the **null hypothesis** $H_0$.
- The **alternative hypothesis** $H_a$ describes the type of evidence we are looking for.

Video Recap

- A **test statistic** is a statistic we can calculate from the data that measures how large the difference is between the data and what would be expected under the null hypothesis.
- Some common test statistics:
  - To test $H_0: \mu=\mu_0$ using a random sample, when $\sigma$ is known: $Z=\dfrac{\bar{X}-\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\overset{a}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,1)$
  - To test $H_0: \mu=\mu_0$ using a normal random sample, when $\sigma$ is not known: $T=\dfrac{\bar{X}-\mu_0}{S/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$
  - To test $H_0: \pi=\pi_0$ using a random sample: $Z=\dfrac{\hat{P}-\pi_0}{\sqrt{\pi_0(1-\pi_0)/n}}\overset{a}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,1)$

## Question 7

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Assume that the true standard deviation for the sleep data is $2.5$.


What formula should we use to calculate the test statistic for the sleep data? 

- [x] $Z=\dfrac{\bar{X}-\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$

- [ ] $Z=\dfrac{\hat{P}-\pi_0}{\sqrt{\pi_0(1-\pi_0)/n}}$

- [ ] $T=\dfrac{\bar{X}-\mu_0}{S/\sqrt{n}}$

What is the observed value of this statistic?

 `-4.79` *(Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places)*


What distribution would this statistic come from, if $H_0$ were true

- [ ] $t_{n-1}$

- [x] $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$

Video Recap

- We calculate a $P$-value to measure how much evidence there is against $H_0$ **in the direction of the alternative hypothesis**.
- The $P$-value is the probability that the test statistic would take a value as or more extreme than the value we actually observed, if $H_0$ were true.

## Question 9

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

What is the $P$-value, for our sleep data?

`0.0000008` (Enter your answer correct to 7 decimal places)

## Question 10

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7hiTtbYxdY" title="L7 09 Conclusion" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Video Recap

- We draw a conclusion based on how small the $P$-value is.
- We often use a **significance level** $\alpha$, decided on **prior to analysis**, to make a decision. If $P<\alpha$. Usually $\alpha=0.05$.

## Question 11

<div class="how_qb">

Based on a P-value of 0.0000008, how much evidence is there that students aren’t getting enough sleep (at least 7 hours, on average)?

- [ ] No evidence
- [ ] Some evidence (inconclusive)
- [ ] Strong evidence
- [x] Very strong evidence
