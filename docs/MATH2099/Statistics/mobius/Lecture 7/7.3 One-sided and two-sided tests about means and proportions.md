## Question 1

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

A Newspoll of $3,008$ Australians, on the week of the 2019 Federal election, found $51.5\%$ of respondents would vote Labour ahead of the Coalition.

Does this provide evidence that the Coalition was headed for defeat ($< 50\%$ of the vote)?

Let $\pi$ be the true proportion of people voting Labour ahead of the coalition. Then

$H_0 : \pi$ <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: '<'},
    {label: '=', selected: true},
    {label: '>'}]" /> `0.5` and $H_a : \pi$ <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: '<'},
    {label: '='},
    {label: '>', selected: true}]" /> `0.5` *(Enter your numerical answers as exact values)*

The test statistic is $z =$ `1.645`. *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places)*

The test statistic comes from a $\mathcal{N}($ `0`  . `1`  $)$ distribution if $H_0$ is true. (Enter the exact values)


The $P$-value is `0.05`  .  *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places)*

Hence, there is <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: 'little'},
    {label: 'some', selected: true}]" /> evidence against $H_0$, that is, there is <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: 'little'},
    {label: 'some', selected: true}]" />  evidence that Labour was set to win the election ($\pi>0$).

Video Recap

- We have a **one-sided test** if the alternative hypothesis has the form $\mu>\mu_0$, or $\mu < \mu_0$, or for proportions, $\pi > \pi_0$, or $\pi < \pi_0$. Examples 1 and 2 are both one-sided tests.
- In Example 3, the null and alternative hypotheses are $H_0: \mu=0.82$ and $H_a:\ \mu \neq 0.82$. Both small and large sample means would argue against the null hypothesis. We want to measure if the sample mean is unusually **far away** from 0.82. This is done using a **two-sided test**.

## Question 3

**Concept**

Video Recap

How you calculate a $P$-value depends on the alternative hypothesis:

- For an alternative of the form $H_a: \theta > \theta_0$, the $P$-value for a test statistic $x$ with null distribution $X$ is calculated as $P(X>x)$.
- For an alternative of the form $H_a: \theta < \theta_0$, the $P$-value for a test statistic $x$ with null distribution $X$ is calculated as $P(X< x)$.
- For an alternative of the form $H_a: \theta \neq \theta_0$, the $P$-value for a test statistic $x$ with null distribution $X$ is calculated as $P(|X|>|x|) = 2P(X>|x|)$.

## Question 4

<div class="how_qb">

In the golf club example, we can test $H_0:\ \mu=0.82$ against $H_a:\ \mu\neq 0.82$ without assuming that the true standard deviation $\sigma$ is known, because we can estimate the standard deviation from the sample data.  In this situation:

(a) The test statistic, and its null distribution, are

- [ ] $z=\frac{\bar{x}-0.82}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ which comes from a $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ distribution if $H_0$ is true.

- [x] $t=\frac{\bar{x}-0.82}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ which comes from a $t_{n-1}$ distribution if $H_0$ is true.

- [ ] $z=\frac{\hat{p}-0.82}{\sqrt{\pi_0(1-\pi_0)/n}}$ which comes from a $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ distribution if $H_0$ is true.

(b) We can calculate a P-value using:

- [ ] $P( Z\geq z )$

- [ ] $P(Z\leq z)$

- [ ] $2P(Z\geq |z|)$

- [ ] $P(T\geq t)$

- [ ] $P(T\leq t)$

- [x] $2P(T\geq |t|)$
