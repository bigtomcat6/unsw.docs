## Question 1

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

In the hypothesis test for Example 1 (sleep), what assumptions did you make? Do these assumptions seem reasonable


	
- [ ] $\hat{P}$ is approximately normal<br>
(Seems reasonable, since $n\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})>5$.)

	
- [ ] The data are normal<br>
(Seems reasonable, from the normal quantile plot.)

	
- [x] We have a random sample.<br>
(Depends on the study design - probably not reasonable in this case.)

	
- [ ] The data are normal<br>
(Does not seem reasonable, from the normal quantile plot.)

	
- [x] The sample mean is normally distributed<br>
(Seems reasonable for a sample size of 185, by the Central Limit Theorem, and since data aren't strongly skewed with big outliers.)

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

In the hypothesis test for Example 2 (pre-election poll), what assumptions did you make? Do these assumptions seem reasonable?  (Tick all answers that apply.


- [ ] The data are normal<br>
(Seems reasonable, from the normal quantile plot.)

- [x] $\hat{P}$ is approximately normal<br>
(Seems reasonable, since $n\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})>5$.)


- [ ] The sample mean is normally distributed<br>
(Seems reasonable for a sample size of $3,008$, by the Central Limit Theorem, and since data aren't strongly skewed with big outliers.)

- [x] We have a random sample.<br>
(Depends on the study design - probably not reasonable in this case.)

- [ ] The data are normal<br>
(Does not seem reasonable, from the normal quantile plot.)

## Question 3

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

In the hypothesis test for Example 3 (golf clubs), what assumptions did you make? Do these assumptions seem reasonable?  (Tick all answers that apply.

	
- [ ] The sample mean is normally distributed<br>
(Seems reasonable, by the Central Limit Theorem, and since data aren't strongly skewed with big outliers.)
	
- [x] The data are normal<br>
(Seems reasonable, from the normal quantile plot.)

- [x] We have a random sample.<br>
(Depends on the study design.)

- [ ] $\hat{P}$ is approximately normal
(Seems reasonable, since $n{\pi_0}(1-{\pi_0})>5$.)

- [ ] The data are normal<br>
(Does not seem reasonable, from the normal quantile plot.)
