Video Recap

In a hypothesis test, there are two possible ways to reach the wrong conclusion:

- P(type I error) $=$ P(reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true) $=\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the significance level of the test.
- P(type II error) $=$ P(fail to reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false) $=\beta$ which depends on the unknown value of the parameter of interest. So this can only be evaluated under a scenario for the alternative hypothesis.
- $1-\beta=$ P(reject $H_0$ when it is false) is also called the **power** of the test.

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

The National Sleep Foundation recommends at least seven hours sleep.
We can test if students get enough sleep, from a sample of 185 students, if we assume the standard deviation is 2.5 hours.
(1) What is the rejection region for $\bar{x}$, of the appropriate test?

$\bar{x} <$  `6.698`  (give your answer to 3 decimal places)

(2) What is the power of the test, at significance level  = 0:05, if we
assume that the true average hours slept by a student is 6.5?

 `0.859` (give your answer to 3 decimal places)
