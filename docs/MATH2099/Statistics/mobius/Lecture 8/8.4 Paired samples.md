## Question 1

<div class="how_qb">

**Concept**

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XKBggM7UaJA" title="L8 12 Paired samples introduction" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Video Recap

- Sometimes we have paired data - in Example 3, there are pairs of measurements at each plant (one before, one after).
- The two-sample $t$-test requires our samples are independent, which they aren't, if the data were collected in pairs of measurements.

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Concept**

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9FSGyeu4w_Y" title="L8 13 Paired differences" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Video Recap

- We can make inferences about the mean difference using the paired differences, $D_i=X_{1i}-X_{2i}$ (e.g. $D=$Before$-$After).
- If the pairs are a random sample, within-pair differences $D_1,D_2,\ldots,D_n$ are also a random sample, with mean $\mu_1-\mu_2$.
- So we can use Lecture 7 methods (one-sample inference about a mean) to make inferences about $\mu_1-\mu_2$ from a sample of paired differences.

## Question 3

<div class="how_qb">

**Concept**

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2zl-L1oQkJM" title="L8 14 Paired samples concept" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Video Recap

To test the hypothesis $H_0: \mu_D=0$ we can use the test statistic:

$$ t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d/\sqrt{n}} $$


$t$ comes from $T\sim t_{n-1}$ distribution if:

- we have a random sample of differences
- the differences are normally distributed

(In practice, this method works well even if $D$ are not normally distributed, as long as $\bar{D}$ is normally distributed.)

## Question 4

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Below are the average weekly losses of worker-hours due to accidents in 10 industrial plants before and after a certain safety program was put into operation.

| Plant  | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Before | 47  | 73  | 46  | 124 | 33  | 56  | 83  | 32  | 26  | 15  |
| After  | 36  | 60  | 44  | 110 | 35  | 51  | 77  | 29  | 26  | 11  |

Use the appropriate procedure to test if the safety program is effective.

Let $\mu_D$ be the true before-after mean difference.

$H_0:\ \mu_D$  <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: '<'},
    {label: '=', selected: true},
    {label: '>'}]" /> `0` and $H_a:\ \mu_D$ <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: '<'},
    {label: '='},
    {label: '>', selected: true}]" /> `0`  *(Enter your numerical answers as exact values)*

The test statistic is $t=$ `3.25`  *(Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places)*

The test statistic comes from a $t_9$ distribution if <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: 'H₀ is true', selected: true},
    {label: 'Hₐ is true'}]" />  .

The $P$-value is `0.005` *(Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places.)*

We conclude that:


- [x] There is good evidence against $H_0$, that is, there is good evidence that the safety program was effective.

- [ ] There is no evidence against $H_0$, that is, there is no evidence that the safety program was effective.

- [ ] There is good evidence for $H_0$, that is, there is good evidence that the safety program was not effective.

- [ ] There is no evidence for $H_0$, that is, there is no evidence that the safety program was not effective.

## Question 5

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

In Example 3, what assumptions did you make? Do they seem reasonable?


- [x] Paired differences are a random sample.<br>&emsp;&nbsp;
(Depends on the study design - we need a random sample of plants.)

- [x] Paired differences are normally distributed.<br>&emsp;&nbsp;
(This assumption looks reasonable, from qqplot.)

- [ ] The sample size is large enough.

- [ ] Paired differences are a random sample.<br>&emsp;&nbsp;
(For the study design, this looks reasonable.)

- [ ] Paired differences are normally distributed.<br>&emsp;&nbsp;
(Depends on the study design.)

## Question 6

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

For Example 3, construct a 95% confidence interval for $\mu_D$, the true average reduction in accidents after the safety program.

( `1.71` , `9.49` )  Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places

## Question 7

<div class="how_qb">

**Concept**

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JkHFIsNN3bw" title="L8 18 Paired samples Matlab" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Video Recap

- There is always a quick way to do stats using a computer!
- For a paired t-test on Matlab, use the $\texttt{ttest}$ function, either as $\texttt{ttest(D)}$ on the differences, or as $\texttt{ttest(X,Y)}$ on the pairs of measurements.

## Question 8

<div class="how_qb">

**Concept**

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgJoLBkZUH0" title="L8 20 Pairing as blocking concept" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Video Recap

- We can think of paired data as having a blocking variable ($B$, say), which is removed by calculating differences.
- Pairing is useful as a technique to control for variation across pairs (due to the blocking variable $B$).
- Pairing gives us a more efficient estimator of mean difference any time there is variation across pairs. 

</div>

## Question 9

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Recall Example 3, the average weekly losses of worker-hours due to accidents in 10 industrial plants before and after a certain safety program was put into operation. Data were collected in a paired design.

Another way to do the experiment would be as follows:

- Choose 20 plants.
- Randomly select 10 at which the safety program is delivered. No safety program for the other 10.
- Compare worker-hours lost to accidents across these treatment groups.

Do you think this would have been a better or worse way to do the study? Explain your answer.


- [x] Worse - it does not control for variation in workplace accidents across plants

- [ ] Better - because it is more efficient

- [ ] Worse - because the independence assumption is not satisfied

Video Recap

- This week we have learnt how to study the association between two variables, when one of them is quantitative, and the other is categorical, but only takes two levels (e.g. to study how rainfall relates to cloud seeding treatment).
- If measurements come in pairs, we have learnt to calculate paired differences and then to analyse as if a single sample from a quantitative variable.
