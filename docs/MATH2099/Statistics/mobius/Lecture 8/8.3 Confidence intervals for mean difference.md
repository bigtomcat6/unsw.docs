## Question 1

<div class="how_qb">

**Concept**

Video Recap

- In the same framework, a $100 \times (1 - \alpha) \%$ two-sided confidence interval for $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ is 
$$ \ \left[ \left(\ \bar{x}_1 -\bar{x}_2 \right) - t_{1-\alpha/2, n_1+n_2-2} s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}} \ , \ \left(\ \bar{x}_1 -\bar{x}_2 \right) + t_{1-\alpha/2, n_1+n_2-2} s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}} \ \right]. $$
if 
  - we have independent random samples of variables $X_1$ and $X_2$,
  - $X_1$ and $X_2$ are normally distributed,
  - the standard deviations of $X_1$ and $X_2$ are equal.

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Does whether or not you are doing a double degree affect how much sleep you get?

Construct a $95\%$ confidence interval for the true difference in hours slept between students who are and are not doing a double degree.

[ `-1.61` , `-0.054` ]  (Enter your answer to 2 decimal places)

## Question 3

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Consider the cloud seeding data.

What are the assumptions of a two-sample test?  Do they seem reasonable?

_(Select all that apply)_

- [x] Independent random samples<br>&emsp;&nbsp;
(Depends on the study design - was it randomised?)

- [ ] Independent random samples<br>&emsp;&nbsp;
(Seems reasonable, from the study design)

- [x] Data come from normal distributions<br>&emsp;&nbsp;
(Seems reasonable after log-transformation)

- [ ] Sample mean difference is normally distributed<br>&emsp;&nbsp;
(Seems reasonable, since $n\pi_0(1-\pi_0)>5$)

- [x] Standard deviations are equal<br>&emsp;&nbsp;
(Satisfied after log-transformation)

## Question 4

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Is there evidence that cloud seeding works? Answer this question using log-transformed data.

Let $\mu_1$ be the true mean log-rainfall for seeded clouds, and let $\mu_2$ be the true mean log-rainfall for unseeded clouds.

$H_0:\ \mu_1=\mu_2$ and $H_a: \mu_1>\mu_2$

The test statistic is `2.54` *(Enter your answer exact to 2 decimal places)*

The $P$-value is `0.007` *(Enter your answer exact to 3 decimal places)*

We conclude that

- [x] There is strong evidence that seeding increases log-rainfall, on average.

- [ ] There is strong evidence that seeding has no effect on log-rainfall, on average.

- [ ] There is no evidence that seeding increases log-rainfall, on average.

- [ ] There is strong evidence that seeding has no effect on log-rainfall, on average.

## Question 5

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true difference in average log-rainfall between seeded and unseeded clouds.

（ `0.24` , `2.05` ）  *Enter your answers exact to 2 decimal places.*

Video Recap

- Most statistical procedures can be implemented pretty easily on a computer!
- To do a two-sample $t$-test on Matlab, the quick way is to use the $\texttt{ttest2}$ function.
