Video Recap

We will make inferences about the true mean difference based on a sample using the following result.

If:

- we have **independent** random samples of variables $X_1$ and $X_2$
- $X_1$ and $X_2$ are normally distributed
- The standard deviations of $X_1$ and $X_2$ are equal ($\sigma_1=\sigma_2$)

then

$$ T = \frac{\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2-(\mu_1-\mu_2)}{S_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}}\, \sim\, t_{n_1+n_2-2}$$


where

$S_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1) S_1^2+(n_2-1) S_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}$


(In practice, this method works well even if $X_1$ and $X_2$ are not normally distributed, as long as $\bar{X}_1$ and $\bar{X}_2$ are normally distributed.)

Video Recap

- You can think of the key two-sample result as an extension of the result we saw previously for one-sample inference about means. 
- We derive the key two-sample result using rules for random variables from lectures 2-4.
- The independent samples assumption is critical, we need independence in order to derive the standa drd error of the sample mean difference.

## Question 4

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

The key two-sample result we will use is:

$$T = \frac{\bar{X}_1-\bar{X}_2-(\mu_1-\mu_2)}{S_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}}\, \sim\, t_{n_1+n_2-2}$$
 
Why is it critical for the two samples to be independent of each other?

- [x] So that the standard error for the sample mean difference is in fact $\sigma\sqrt{1/n_1+1/n_2}$.

- [ ] So that we can assume that the sample means are normally distributed.

- [ ] So that the sample size is large enough for the method to work correctly
