Video Recap

To test the hypothesis $H_0:\ \mu_1=\mu_2$ we can use the test statistic:

$$t = \frac{\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2}{s_p\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}} $$


where $s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1) s_1^2+(n_2-1) s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}$ and $t$ comes from a $t_{n_1+n_2-2}$ distribution if:

- we have **independent** random samples of variables $X_1$ and $X_2$
- $X_1$ and $X_2$ are normally distributed
- The standard deviations of $X_1$ and $X_2$ are equal

(In practice, this method works well even if $X_1$ and $X_2$ are not normally distributed, as long as $\bar{X}_1$ and $\bar{X}_2$ are normally distributed.)

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Does whether or not you are doing a double degree affect how much sleep you get?  Use the class data ($\texttt{hoursSlept.csv}$) to test this hypothesis.

Let $\mu_1$ be the true mean hours slept by double degree students.

Let $\mu_2$ be the true mean hours slept by students not doing a double degree.

We test $H_0: \mu_1$ <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: '≠'},
    {label: '>'},
    {label: '<'},
    {label: '=', selected: true}]" /> $\mu2$ against $H_1: \mu_1$ <HSelect type="Mobius" :values="[
    {label: '='},
    {label: '>'},
    {label: '<'},
    {label: '≠', selected: true}]" /> $\mu2$

The test statistic is    *Enter your answer correct to 2 decimal places*

which would come from a $t$ distribution with   degrees of freedom is $H_0$ were true.

The $P$-value is  *Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places*

We conclude that

- [ ] There is no evidence that the true means differ, that is, there is no evidence that sleep is related to doing a double degree

- [x] There is some evidence that the true means differ, that is, there is some evidence that sleep is related to doing a double degree

- [ ] There is no evidence that the true means are the same, that is, there is no evidence that sleep is unrelated to doing a double degree

- [ ] There is some evidence that the true means are the same, that is, there is some evidence that sleep is unrelated to doing a double degree
