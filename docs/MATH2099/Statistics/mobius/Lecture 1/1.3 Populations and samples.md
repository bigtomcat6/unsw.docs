## Question 1

<div class="how_qb">

**Concept**

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4vQ2E7fFRAI" title="L1 4 Population" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Video Recap

- Usually, we are interested in obtaining information about a total collection of elements, which is referred to as the **population**
- The elements are often called **(individuals)** (or ***units***)
- Given the research question, we have observed some characteristic for each individual. This characteristic, which could be quantitative or qualitative, is called a **variable**

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Recall the cloud seeding example. To recap, cloud seeding is the attempt to change the amount of precipitation that falls from clouds, by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud condensation and we are interested in whether cloud seeding using a given substance (say, silver nitrate) really works.

Determine the population, individuals and variables in the study by matching them with the appropriate option.

1. All clouds in the sky: **Population**
2. Amount of rainfall: **Variables**
3. A cloud: **Individuals**

## Question 3

<div class="how_qb">

**Concept**

<iframe width="672" height="378" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QOsyQZJE9tE" title="L1 6 Sample" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Video Recap
- The subset of the population which is effectively observed is called the **sample**.
- The **data** are the measurements that are actually collected over the sample in the course of the investigation.

**Exercise**

We are going to look at what the sample and the data is in our cloud seeding example. In case you need a recap:
- Cloud seeding is the attempt to change the amount of precipitation that falls from clouds, by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud condensation and we are interested in whether cloud seeding using a given substance (say, silver nitrate) really works.
