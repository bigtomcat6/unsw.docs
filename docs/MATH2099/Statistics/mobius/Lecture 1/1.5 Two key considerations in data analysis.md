Video Recap
- When deciding how to analyse data, there are two key considerations:
    - What are the main ***Properties*** of the data?
    - What is the ***research Question***?

</div>

## Question 2

<div class="how_qb">

**Example**

Below are the average weekly losses of worker-hours due to accidents in 10 industrial plants before and after a certain safety program was put into operation.

| Plant | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4   | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | 10 |
|-------|----|----|----|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Before| 47 | 73 | 46 | 124 | 33 | 58 | 83 | 32 | 26 | 15 |
| After | 36 | 60 | 44 | 119 | 35 | 51 | 77 | 29 | 26 | 11 |

How should we plot the data?

Video Recap

- Other important aspects of the research question:
    - Is it ***descriptive*** or asking for ***inference***?
    - Are we trying to ***estimate*** a key quantity, or ***test a specific hypothesis***?

</div>

## Question 4

<div class="how_qb">

**Exercise**

Match the following aspects to the appropriate research question.

1. What is the effect of cloud seeding?: **Estimating a key quantity**
2. Is there an effect of cloud seeding?: **Testing a specific hypothesis**
