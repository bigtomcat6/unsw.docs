- Your exam is in Anita B. Lawrence Centre Labs (H13 Centre Wing), where you had your tutorials and lab classes. The exam waiting area for most students is the [Chancellor's Garden](https://goo.gl/maps/KP8gEEnGK3R19tHg8) which is the garden between the Anita B. Lawrence Centre and Old Main Building, make sure you know where this is. 
- Exam rules: <https://student.unsw.edu.au/exam-rules> (Note that additional rules apply to this exam. These are described below and in other information.)
- Special consideration: <https://www.student.unsw.edu.au/special-consideration> (Be sure that you know in advance the evidence you will need if you miss the exam due to illness or misadventure.)
- Timetable: <https://student.unsw.edu.au/exam-timetable> (Rules about circumstances for which alternative arrangements may apply are here.)


##### How is the exam conducted?

- The exam will be invigilated the **Anita B. Lawrence Centre Labs** under usual exam conditions. Each student will be provided with a desktop computer running Linux. Information on the allowed materials is below.
- The exam will be **on Möbius** and similar in style to the recent practice exams that are available on Möbius.
- **Students must bring their UNSW student ID cards and their mobile phone** for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The phone will be allowed only to login to the computer and Möbius. 
- Internet access other than for Möbius will be blocked.
- To accommodate all students, there will be several exam sessions. Please refer to the Final Exam booking page on Moodle for the exam starting time you chose or has been assigned to you. You should **arrive at least 15 minutes before** the scheduled exam start time at the waiting area indicated on the booking page. 
- The exam duration will be **2 hours**. 
- Each question will show how many marks it is worth. **Questions can be completed in any order.**


How to prepare?
How to prepare - Linear Algebra: 

- The best way to prepare yourself is to go over the lectures and tutorial exercises. 
- On Mobius: practice the two quizzes and the Linear Algebra part of the 2022 exam (unit **“Exam 2022 (Linear Algebra)”** in Mobius), to give you an idea of the type of questions that can be asked in the exam. 

 How to prepare - Statistics: 

- On Mobius: go through the revision version of Online Lectures, practice the Lecture quizzes, Midterm Practice Test, Past Exams Practice. Use MATLAB for your calculations! 
- Solve practice class exercises and lab exercises. Solve problems using pen and paper, and use MATLAB for your calculations.
  - The Statistics part of the Final exam will cover **all the material presented in** **Online Lectures: Revision, 1-5, 7-10**. There will be slightly more emphasis on Statistical Inference (Online Lectures 4-5 and 7-10).
  - The questions are designed on Mobius and **they have a similar structure to the online lecture quizzes, mid-term test and past final exams that are available on Mobius (see "Past Exams Practice" unit on Mobius)** 
  - You will have to either select the correct answer (e.g. from a drop-down list) or compute a value (e.g. correct to 4 decimal places). Some answers will require you to type explanations as text in the provided boxes (they will be graded manually).
  - You will be asked to copy and paste data (on Linux machines, right-click mouse to copy and paste) and use MATLAB to answer some questions (see online quizzes). You will not be asked to import any data files. You will not be asked to do simulations on MATLAB. 


##### What exam materials will be provided, allowed and not allowed?


The only materials you can bring to the exam are:

- pens, pencils and UNSW-approved calculator. 

Everything else is not allowed. For example, the following is not allowed:

- blank paper, laptop, headset, USB memory key, your own notes or copies of the course notes.
- general access to the internet.

The following will be provided for you to use during the exam:
Paper for working out.You will be able to use MATLAB on the computer, which will be needed for some Statistics questions. You may also use Maple on the computer. Either Maple or MATLAB can be used for the Linear Algebra questions, but note that the Linear Algebra questions will usually require exact answers, not decimals.The following Statistics course notes and reference material will be available in PDF format on the computer:

   [Lecture Slides (Statistics)](https://moodle.telt.unsw.edu.au/pluginfile.php/12248294/mod_page/content/6/Lectures_all.pdf) 

   [Formula Sheet (Statistics)](https://moodle.telt.unsw.edu.au/pluginfile.php/12248294/mod_page/content/6/formulasheet_exam.pdf) 

   [Statistics Using Matlab (SUM) notes](https://moodle.telt.unsw.edu.au/pluginfile.php/12248294/mod_page/content/6/statsmatlab2023.pdf) 

No course notes and other reference material will be available for Linear Algebra. 
Note, you **cannot access course material on Mobius**, including linear algebra quizzes, revision versions of statistics online lectures and quizzes, practice statistics mid-term and past exams, **from 8AM on the day of the exam**.

##### No help is allowed during the exam and the exam must be kept confidential

- All of your answers must be entirely your own work.
- You cannot receive help from or give help to others during the exam.
- You must not communicate anything about the content of the exam during your exam.
- You cannot take any photos or written copies of the exam questions out of the exam room.
- After the exam, you must not discuss anything about the exam with anyone until all exam sessions are completed.
- The Drop-in Centre, staff consultation, and staff help in the Moodle forums will not be available for maths related questions from the time the first exam is available.

##### Academic misconduct 


- Should any form of academic misconduct be detected, breaching the Student Code (<https://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/studentcodepolicy.pdf>), the University may take disciplinary action under the Student Misconduct (<https://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/studentcodepolicy.pdf>) or Plagiarism  (<https://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/plagiarismprocedure.pdf>) Procedure.
- In recent terms, cases of academic misconduct were uncovered in exams, tests and assignments in the School resulting in significant penalties for the students involved.
- If you find evidence of exam misconduct and wish to report it, you can do so confidentially by contacting the course authorities by email.

##### Special consideration

- If you cannot take your exam for reasons beyond your control, you may be eligible to apply for special consideration.  Please the special consideration information on the web: <https://student.unsw.edu.au/special-consideration>
