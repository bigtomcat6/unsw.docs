Project Brief: Custom Clock with Laboratory Timer Functions

::: details

1. Project Description

In a biochemistry laboratory, technicians need to manage various processes, such as chemical
reactions, and keep track of their durations. Each laboratory technician deals with a consistent
set of tasks (one to four tasks) over several months. Currently, each technician uses multiple
individual clocks for this, which is not very productive. They have asked us to design a custom
clock that integrates both specialised laboratory timer functions and standard clock features.
