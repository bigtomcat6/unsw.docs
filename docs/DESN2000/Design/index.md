Dear students,

My apologies for missing the 1-2 pm lecture today. It has been recorded between 4-5 pm on the 28th of May. To access it, click this link. In case you can't access the talk through the link, you can use the full URL below: 

<https://unsw-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/z3505506_ad_unsw_edu_au1/ESUsTUHuoXxDkyNUibclyCsBg1IzPx9fsJPL7ybhHu1b6A?e=f5RzJf>

Next week's lecture at the normal time, between 1-2 pm in Clancy; I'll certainly be there.

Best, Ilpo

Design is one of the critical foundations of engineering and a main component in creating value. A good engineer has complex technical skills, but also creative skills, project management and teamworking skills, and knowledge of professional ethical standards in design. 

DESN2000 aims to further develop your skills in engineering design with a particular focus on the early stages, where innovative concepts are created in response to open-ended problems. These skills will be developed in the context of an engineering project, with a focus on three areas: (1) research techniques needed to understand design problems and discover concepts, (2) technical skills needed to build a concept, and (3) evaluation methods for evaluating the concept. Alongside the development of design skills, the course also aims to develop your readiness for professional practice by deepening your understanding and skills in effective project management, teamwork and communication.

The course builds on the teamwork, communication, and project management skills introduced in ENGG1000/DESN1000. Skills learned in DESN2000 are further deepened in DESN3000, which will develop skills for managing design in commercial context.

This term DESN2000 is being taught by six schools:

### **Where to ask for help?**

1. Every project stream has its own MS Teams group (except for computer engineering which uses [EdStem](https://edstem.org/au/join/xCszHE)), which is the main tool for communication and the best spot to field your questions and find updated information on lectures, workshops and assessments;
2. For discipline-specific materials, get in touch with your project coordinator.
3. For common design lectures and assessments (Design Journal and Design Presentation), get in touch with Ilpo Koskinen via [ilpo.koskinen@unsw.edu.au](mailto:a.vignati@unsw.edu.au) or via Teams
4. Every class gets assigned a demonstrator, you should check with them first before asking the project coordinator

### Summary of Assessment Tasks

The course has four main assessments. They are designed to support your design process. Please note that assessment 4 is a hurdle: you must pass it to pass the course. For information about the assessment. Assessments 1-3 are submitted below in the design assessments section. To submit Assessment 4, you need to go to your School's project section.

| **Assessment**            | **Due Date**             | **Weight**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                     | **Feedback**                                   |

## Design Journal: Research and Concept, Week 3

- <HGlobalLink title="" md5=""/>

::: note
Your journal is an active record of your design work. It is submitted in two parts. This part is for quick feedback for you, and targets the very early phase of design from problem statement and research to concept generation.

The report in Word or PDF format is to be submitted by each student on Moodle. Late penalties will be applied as per the course outline policy (flat -5% penalty per day).

Page limit: the main body of the Design Journal is limited to 10 pages. Max file size 20 MB. Note that the length limit excludes the title page and summary, biography and appendix.
