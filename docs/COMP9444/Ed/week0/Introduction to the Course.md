## Introduction to the Course

### Welcome to COMP9444 Neural Networks and Deep Learning!

Popular conceptions about Artificial Intelligence in the late 20th Century are nicely illustrated in this image from the classic film "2001: A Space Odyssey". For the original audience, the idea of a computer beating a human at Chess was considered outrageous. In contrast, the idea of a computer casually conversing with humans, identifying and classifying objects within a room hardly seemed shocking at all. Because humans perform these tasks so effortlessly, even unconsciously, the difficulty of reproducing them in computers was greatly underestimated.

In reality, Deep Blue defeated the human Chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1996, but it was not until nearly two decades later that computers were finally able to perform tasks such as object recognition and machine translation with any degree of precision. These advances were made possible by a class of models called Deep Neural Networks which are inspired by the structure of the human brain.

This course aims to introduce students to the main topics and methods in the field of neural networks and deep learning, ranging from traditional neural network models to the latest research and applications. Topics will include: perceptrons, feedforward neural networks, backpropagation, deep convolutional networks, image processing; geometric analysis of trained networks; recurrent networks, language processing, semantic analysis, long short term memory; deep reinforcement learning; autoencoders, generative models, adversarial training; designing successful applications of neural networks; recent developments in neural networks and deep learning.

### Student Learning Outcomes

After completing COMP9444, students should be able to:

- discuss the social, intellectual and neurobiological context of neural networks and deep learning;
- describe a variety of NN and DL techniques - including fully connected, convolutional and recurrent networks, deep reinforcement learning, generative models and adversarial training;
- examine a problem, devise a suitable neural network solution, and analyse the behaviour and performance of the trained network;
- use a Python module or simulation package to implement neural networks for a range of tasks, including image and language processing, reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning.

- Thursday 11am - 1pm in Mathews Theatre A (K-D23-201)  for the material from lesson (b).

There will be Tutorials in Weeks 1 to 5, and mentoring sessions for the Group Project in Weeks 7 to 10.

You are expected to:

- review the course materials before and after each scheduled class

- complete relevant Quizzes, Coding Exercises, Assignment and Project
- discuss the material with your fellow students
- consider exploring topics of particular interest by writing and running your own programs
- ask questions and contribute to the discussion in the online forums

Questions and discussion relating to all aspects of the course can be posted to the discussion board on this Ed site.
