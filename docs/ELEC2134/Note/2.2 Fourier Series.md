## Signal Definition:
- A **signal** is a time-varying or space-varying function $f(t)$, $v(t)$, or $I(x, y)$.
- Signals represent physical quantities, such as:
  - **Sound  signals**: Pressure values varying over time and space.
  - **Electromagnetic signals**: Light signals, etc.
  - **Bio-signals**: Electric potential measured by devices like EEG or ECG.

## Fourier Series - Motivation:
- **Why use Fourier series?**
  - It is difficult to directly calculate circuit output in the time domain when inductors and capacitors are involved.
  - By decomposing a non-sinusoidal signal into sinusoidal components, phasor analysis and superposition can be used to calculate the output.

## Trigonometric Fourier Series:
- The Fourier series of a periodic function $f(t)$ is a representation that decomposes $f(t)$ into a **DC component** and an **AC component** composed of harmonic sinusoids.
- For a periodic function $f(t) = f(t + nT)$, where $T$ is the period and $\omega_0 = \frac{2\pi}{T}$ is the fundamental frequency in radians per second.
  
### Fourier Coefficients:
- The coefficients $a_0$, $a_n$, and $b_n$ are determined by integrating over a period:
  - $a_0$: Average (DC) component.
  - $a_n$ and $b_n$: Coefficients for cosine and sine terms, respectively.

## Symmetry Considerations:
- If a signal has symmetry, the calculation of Fourier coefficients can be simplified.
  - **Even symmetry**: $f(t) = f(-t)$
  - **Odd symmetry**: $f(t) = -f(-t)$
  - **Half-wave symmetry**: $f(t - \frac{T}{2}) = -f(t)$

## Exponential Fourier Series:
- A compact form of expressing Fourier series using **Euler's identity** to represent sine and cosine functions.
- The exponential Fourier series uses complex coefficients $c_n$, where:
  $$
  f(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} c_n e^{jn\omega_0 t}
  $$
- The coefficients $c_n$ are related to the coefficients of the trigonometric form.

## Applications of Fourier Series:
- **Determine circuit output** in the time domain.
- **Analyze the frequency spectrum** of a circuit output.
- **Calculate the average power** delivered by a circuit.
