### Getting Started

Welcome to ELEC2134 in T3 2024! I look forward to working with you on this course.

This course continues on directly from ELEC1111, and assumes **mastery** of all ELEC1111 topics, because ELEC2134 problems depend very strongly on accurate ELEC1111 skills. It is strongly recommended to refresh your knowledge of circuit analysis techniques, transient responses, sinusoidal analysis and phasors, etc. You will also need to be confident and accurate in your use of first-year maths techniques, including linear algebra, complex numbers, differential calculus and integral calculus. To revise, please consult <https://www.youtube.com/user/MathsStatsUNSW>.

The recommended book for ELEC2134 is the same as the recommended book for ELEC1111 (C. K. Alexander and M. N. O. Sadiku, Fundamentals of Electric Circuits, 7th ed., New York, NY, USA: McGraw-Hill, 2017). Specific sets of problems from the book and quizzes can be accessed online via McGraw Hill Connect using the link below (IMPORTANT NOTE: you are allowed to access the quizzes and review exercises even if you do not purchase the book).

- <HMoodleLink type='pdf' md5='5810e22fd86906d1497bdb116eddb3fd'>McGrawHill Connect Registration Steps</HMoodleLink>

Please ensure that you attend the labs and have your attendance marked. Note that when you have completed your lab, you can work on lecture revision or other problems from the course (individually or as a group), and - if the demonstrators are not busy helping or marking other students with the lab (which takes priority) - you may ask the demonstrators for guidance. This is the purpose of attending for the full 3 hours.

**Changes to lab times are permitted only with the written permission** of the Head Laboratory Demonstrator, Mr. Timothy Leask (t.leask@student.unsw.edu.au). Students arriving at non-scheduled lab times may be denied entry and/or assistance/assessment.

### Forums and Drop-in Centre

### Surveys and Feedback

<img src="./img/myexperience.png" alt="myExperience" style="zoom:25%;" />

Telling us about your experience of learning and teaching at UNSW can make a big difference. What you say is confidential and you will not be identified to any of your teachers.

**A quick link will be available at the top of the course page once this survey opens towards the end of the teaching period.**

**<u>Week 1</u>**

Lecture Week 1 Tuesday (9am - 12pm) - ELEC2134 course information, AC review

Lecture Week 1 Wednesday (4pm - 6pm) - AC Power

:::

Please note that lecture recordings are automatically made available on Teams after the lecture. For Teams meetings in a particular channel (e.g., Lectures channel), the recording is stored in the Teams site under the **Files** tab of that channel in a folder named **Recordings**.

This page also contains the URL links to the recorded Microsoft Teams sessions.

Note that for the lectures you can also use the Lecture Recordings link, which include Echo360 recordings. Depending on your audio/camera preferences you can choose to watch the Echo360 recordings or the Teams recordings. However, note that Echo 360 recordings are scheduled to start at XX:05 and finish at YY:55, since we need to give time to the next person to prepare (this is centrally managed and cannot be changed). This means that you may miss the last 2 or 3 minutes of the lecture, although I will try my best to finish by YY:55 (if that is the case and you still prefer Echo360, you can watch those few minutes in the Teams recording).

### Quizzes

ELEC2134 quizzes will be accessed via Moodle (Course Content --> Week XX --> Progress Quiz) from **Week 1.**

**IMPORTANT: Always use at least 2 decimal places throughout your calculation and in your answers.** Quizzes are marked automatically and answers have a certain tolerance (2%) to account for rounding errors, but if you do not use at least 2 decimal places in your answers, it is quite likely that your answer is marked wrong because it will not be within the tolerance range.

- Quiz opens from **Tuesday 11****:59pm to the next Tuesday 11:59pm**, starting from **week 1.**
- **3 attempts, immediate right/wrong feedback after each attempt.** You will always get the **highest mark as final mark.**
- **Detailed feedback provided after due date**.
- Circuit parameters are distributed randomly among the class. 

### Mid-Term Exam

The mid-term exam will be held **in person** on **Wednesday, October 9th during the lecture time (4-6pm)**. Information about the venue will be released closer to the date.

The exam is 100 minutes in duration, closed book and it will cover all content and material from Week 1 to Week 4.

You will need a pen, UNSW approved calculator and your UNSW photo ID card.

### Final Exam

</div>


<div class="moodle_section">

## Week 0

**Lectures start in Week 1 on Tuesday 9:00 and Wednesday 16:00 at Law Theatre G04.**

**Labs start in Week 1**. <u>Each lab session must be attended completely, including Week 1</u>. There are two weeks to complete each lab sheet, and assessment (live) is normally in the second week for each sheet.

Required lab materials are the same as for ELEC1111 - a lab notebook (or carefully recorded notes from a tablet app like OneNote) and enclosed footwear. A prototyping board (breadboard) may be required for some activities. 

**Note that, in general, significant analytical preparation is required for each lab** (start early to avoid losing lab time on analytical parts). **If the lab problems look too difficult, that is because it is assumed that you will first revise examples and exercises from the lectures and supplementary material _before_ attempting the lab problems.** 

Preparation for Lab 1: Read through LAB 1 SECTION 1 and the introductory LTSpice materials below. Try on the steps to simulate the DC circuit shown in Section1. You will also prepare a lab book (an A4 size notebook containing a mix of plain pages and graph sheets, which you need to purchase, but you might be able to get away without the graph sheets) for the labs from weeks 1 to 10. Some students use a tablet device with pen input instead, but you will definitely need something you can write on. Students attending labs may also need a breadboard (prototyping board), which you can buy from EEG15 or any electronics shop.
